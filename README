Play 2.0 Framework
==================

To familiarise myself with Scala, Play & MongoDB I'm re-writing my photobook library that monitors the new and used prices of my 
photobooks using the Amazon API.

(previously available at http://photobooks.mhurd.com but the website is now driven by my Clojure/ClojureScript version, 
see: https://github.com/mhurd/books)

This is a work in progress (and progress may be slow and job and two kids leaves little time!)
