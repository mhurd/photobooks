Play 2.0 Framework
==================

To familiarise myself with Scala, Play & MongoDB I'm re-writing my photobook library
(currently available at http://photobooks.mhurd.com) that monitors the new and used prices of my
photobooks using the Amazon API.

This is a work in progress (and progress may be slow and job and two kids leaves little time!)
